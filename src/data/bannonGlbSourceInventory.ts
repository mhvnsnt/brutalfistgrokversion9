/**
 * Evidence-only inventory of Bannon GLBs discovered in the current Drive-sync manifest.
 *
 * HARD RULE: this file is NOT a playable roster. Entries here are source evidence only.
 * A discovered GLB must still be banked/mapped, rigged, skin-QA'd, rest-pose validated and
 * explicitly promoted before it can appear in BANNON_GLB_PLAYABLE_MODELS.
 *
 * NO GLB = NO CHARACTER. Conversely, a GLB alone does not grant PLAYABLE status.
